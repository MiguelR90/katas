1. The Big Oh Notation

* Common complexity functions: log n, n, n log n, n^2, 2^n, n!
    - Roughly the same time for n = 10
    - Algos with O(n!) running time become useless for n â‰¥ 20
    - Algos with O(2^n) become impractical for n > 40
    - Algos with O(n^2) remain usable for approx n = 10,000... but hopeless for n > 1,000,000
    - O(n) and O(n log n) algorithms remain practical on inputs of one billion items
    - O(log n) algorithms are tractible and preferred for any input

* Selection sort has complexity O(n^2)
